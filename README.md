# 1. Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This article will teach you how and when to use all the advanced tools from the Sklearn Pipelines ecosystem to build custom, scalable, and modular machine learning models that can easily be deployed in production.
<br/><br/>
In isolation, there is much content about different components from the Sklearn Pipelines toolbox. I am writing this article because it is precious to see how all those components work together into a single, more complex system.
<br/><br/>
As an example, we will build a forecasting model to predict the following year's global mean wheat yield.
<br/><br/>
I will show you how and when to use the following components:
* [TransformerMixin](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.TransformerMixin.html)
* [BaseEstimator](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.base.BaseEstimator.html)
* [FunctionTransformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.FunctionTransformer.html)
* [ColumnTransformer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer.html)
* [FeatureUnion](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.pipeline.FeatureUnion.html)
* [TransformedTargetRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.compose.TransformedTargetRegressor.html)

# 2. Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The code is tested with:
* Python 3.9
* Conda 4.12

Create & activate a conda virtual environment:
```shell
conda create --name professional-sklearn-pipelines python=3.9
conda activate professional-sklearn-pipelines
```

Install requirements:
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# 3. Data <a name="data"></a>
We have used the **dataset** [1](#data) provided by [Pangaea](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.909132), which tracks global yearly yields for various plants from 1981 to 2016.

Download the dataset [here](https://doi.pangaea.de/10.1594/PANGAEA.909132) and unzip it.
The code expects the data to be in the Sklearn Pipelines tutorial's root folder under a directory named `yields`.

**NOTE:** We found this dataset in this cool [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/awesomedata/awesome-public-datasets). 
You can find all sorts of amazing datasets here for various prototypes or tutorials.

# 4. Usage <a name="usage"></a>
## Files Structure
After you download the data the structure of the project should look like this:
```text
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ images
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pipeline_tutorial.ipynb
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ publish.py
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ yields
```

## Run
Everything is within a single notebook called `pipeline_tutorial.ipynb`.

Therefore, it is enough to run:
```shell
jupyter notebook pipeline_tutorial.ipynb
```

## 5. Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements <a name="licensing"></a>
Everything is licensed under the MIT license. Therefore, please use, share, and play with the code as long as you give credit to the original author.

I want to thank Pangaea for its contribution to making the data available. Without their assistance, I would not have been able to train the models.
